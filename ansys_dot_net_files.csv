Using a strain energy method,a closed form solution for the effective stiffness of the suspension system is developed, which is confirmed using finite element modeling. A comparative study of the suspension with a commonly used serpentine spring suspension demonstrates that the studied device is robust to thermal fluctuations and residual stresses. A parametric analysis is used to identify an appropriate micromachining technology suitable for the fabrication of the angular gyroscope.""</i>",730,10,7

InputFile,GeneralInput,DAKOTA,Dave Lindeman (3M),http://ansys.net/macros/dakota.zip,"<i>""I recently experimented with coupling ANSYS and DAKOTA, and thought the list might be interested in the results.  DAKOTA, if you're not familiar with it, is a public-domain optimization code available from Sandia National Laboratories (see http://endo.sandia.gov/DAKOTA/).  It has several advanced optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms), supports discrete variables, and has several other features that make it a nice complement to the optimization and probabilistic design modules within ANSYS.  And it's FREE.<br>&nbsp;<br>

""Anyways, the procedure for using DAKOTA with ANSYS consists of creating a DAKOTA input file (DAKOTA in the attachments) that identifies the design variables, state variables, optimization method, etc.  Also, within this file you identify the command to be issued to execute the code you are using to generate the response variables (analysis_driver = 'ansys.prl', in the attached example).  To execute ANSYS I use an intermediate Perl script (ansys.prl) that translates the design variable file generated by DAKOTA (parameters_file = 'dakota.dv') into something ANSYS can understand (written out to ansys.dv).  The Perl script then executes ANSYS.  Note that the Perl script is general purpose -- it should work for any application.  The only thing you should need to change is filenames, in particular the name of your ANSYS script (in my example, 'ANSYS').  The ANSYS script reads in the design variable file using /INPUT, performs the analysis, then outputs the result variables to a file (results_file = 'dakota.rv') using *CFOPEN and *VWRITE.<br>&nbsp;<br>

""To execute the analysis you use (for example) the command line:  dakota -i DAKOTA &gt; dakota.log &amp;<br>&nbsp;<br>

This example provides an illustration of using the parametric functionality of the ANSYS Workbench environment for a highly nonlinear application. The Workbench environment can be used to perform design iterations in conjunction with material laws only available in the standard ANSYS environment. A shape memory superelastic material law was formally included in ANSYS 8.0. The material law captures the super-elastic behavior of Nitinol (4) along with its unique hysteretic response under cyclic loading. In the demonstration, the eyeglass frame is subjected to crushing and cyclic loading events. Geometric design variables are varied in an attempt to increase the frame stiffness yet keep the peak strain levels in the frame below 10% strain, which is a typical elastic limit for Nitinol. The cyclic behavior of the material is also monitored under the design load to evaluate the potential of fatigue failure. The procedure demonstrates the ease in interfacing the suite of Workbench products with geometric, material and contact nonlinear analysis problems.""</i><p></p>

Papers,Nonlinear Electronics,Finite Element Analysis for Solder Ball Connect (SBC) Structural Design Optimization,J.S. Corbin,http://ansys.net/papers/ibmrd3705C.pdf,"<i>""Solder Ball Connect (SBC) is a second-level
surface mount electronics packaging
technology in which ceramic modules
containing one or more chips are joined to a
circuit card (FR-4) by means of an array of
nonhomogeneous solder columns. These
columns consist of a high-temperature-melting
90%Pb/lO%Sn solder sphere attached to the
module and card with eutectic solder fillets.
The solder structures accommodate the bulk
of the strain (which is due to the thermal-
expansion mismatch between FR-4 and the
9211 ceramic of the modules) generated during
power cycling. If the solder structures are not
properly designed, the thermal strain can be a
source of premature fatigue failure. In this
work, finite element analysis is used to
characterize the plastic strains that develop
in the SBC interconnection during thermal
cycling. Since plastic strain is a dominant
parameter that influences low-cycle fatigue, it
is used as a basis of comparison for various
structural alternatives. Designed experiment
techniques are used to systematically evaluate
the thermal strain sensitivity to structural
variables. Results are used to identify an
optimally reliable structure that is robust in

Transient temperature profiles of selected

to describe the primary heat-transport
mechanisms. Numerical predictions and
empirical data indicate that the SBC modules
are relatively isothermal throughout the
infrared reflow process. Therefore, every
solder ball within the array exhibits a nearly
identical thermal profile. This result is
fortunate, since the inner solder ball

Papers,Electronics Nonlinear,Effect of Simulation Methodology on Solder Joint Crack Growth Correlation,Robert Darveaux,http://ansys.net/papers/RDARV_Article1200.pdf,"<i>""A generalized solder joint fatigue life model for surface
mount packages was previously published in Refs [1,2]. The
model is based on correlation to measured crack growth data
on BGA joints during thermal cycling. It was subsequently
discovered by Anderson et.al. that the ANSYS TM 5.2 finite
element code used in the model had an error in its method for
calculating plastic work [3]. It was shown that significant
error in life prediction could result by using a recent version
of the code where the bug has been fixed. The error comes
about since the original crack growth constants were derived
based on plastic work calculations that had the bug.
<br>
In this paper, crack initiation and growth constants are re-calculated
using ANSYS 5.6. In addition, several other
model related issues are explored with respect to the crack
growth correlations. For example, 3D slice models were
compared to quarter symmetry models. Anandâ€™s constitutive
model was compared with Darveauxâ€™s constitutive model. It
was shown that the crack growth rate dependence on strain
energy density always had an exponent of 1.10 +/- 0.15. This
is in the range of the original correlation, so the accuracy of
relative predictions should still be within +/- 25%. However,
the accuracy of absolute predictions could be off by a factor
of 7 in the worst case, if the analyst uses a modeling
procedure that is not consistent with that used for the crack
growth correlation. The key to good accuracy is to maintain
consistency in the modeling procedure.""</i>",940,10,6

Papers,Medical,Off-Axis Loads Cause Failure of the Distal Radius at Lower Magnitudes than Axial Loads: A Finite Element Analysis,Karen L. Troy and Mark D. Grabiner,http://ansys.net/papers/26.pdf,"<i>""Distal radius fractures are among the most
common fall-related injuries in older
women. Numerous studies have quantified
upper extremity fall biomechanics with the
goal of identifying possible interventions to
reduce the peak force on the wrists, thereby
reducing the number of fractures.
Fracture initiation depends both on the force
applied to the bone and upon the strength of
the bone itself; thus, poor bone quality has
been implicated as a factor in distal radius
fractures. Generally, an intervention to
improve bone quality (such as antiresorptive
therapy) is considered successful
if bone mineral density (BMD) can be
increased by 2-4%.<br>
Cadaver and finite element studies have
previously quantified the force required to
cause a distal radius fracture. To date,
however, only simple axial loads on the
radius have been considered. Because most
falls onto the hands result in off-axis loads,
we considered the possibility that a
combination of loading modes would
significantly influence the fracture strength
of the distal radius. Here, we used a
validated finite element model of the distal
radius, scaphoid, and lunate, to explore the
effects of loading direction and changes in
BMD on predicted fracture strength.""</i><br>

Papers,Automotive,Design Optimization of an Automotive Universal Joint Considering Manufacturing Cost,Nick Cristello and Il Yong Kim,http://ansys.net/papers/p499-cristello.pdf,"<i>""This paper presents the shape optimization of an
automotive universal joint, by simultaneously considering
manufacturing cost, maximum drivable joint angle and
part volume. Comprised of three main components - two
yokes and a cross trunnion - a universal joint is a linkage
used to transmit rotational motion from one shaft to
another when the axes are coplanar, but not coinciding. In
this research, universal joint designs are analyzed and
compared using a weighted sum of three objective
functions: minimization of machining cost, maximization
of adjoining shaft joint angle, and minimization of total
part volume. Part modeling and analysis is conducted
using the Finite Element Analysis package ANSYS and
optimization is implemented using MATLAB. The
results show Pareto frontiers for both the flange and weld
yoke, constructed using the Adaptive Weighted Sum
technique. These frontiers clearly illustrate the trade-off
between machining cost and joint angle; that is, to
increase the joint angle, a corresponding increase in the
cost of the part is required. It has been shown that
maximization of driveable joint angle requires a
simultaneous increase in machining cost of 4.4% and
2.7% for the flange and weld yoke, respectively.""</i><br>

Despite this wealth of features, however, one may wish to incorporate oneâ€™s own
creep law into ANSYS. For example, a company may have their own creep equation
with material parameters already defined and validated through testing. The built-in
creep laws in ANSYS assume creep used in design rather than failure analysis, so the
available creep laws are meant to model primary and secondary creep â€“ consequently,
another need to incorporate a user-defined creep law would arise when a user wants to
include tertiary creep and/or to evaluate creep damage.<br>
This memo will hope to address some aspects of writing oneâ€™s own user-defined
creep law with the USERCREEP.F subroutine to address this issue.""</i><br>

In the input file, change the first two parameters as follows:
<ul>
<li>For results with many modes included and no residual vector, set MY_FREQUENCY = 1 and MY_RESVECTOR = 0
<li>For results with few modes included and no residual vector, set 
MY_FREQUENCY = 0 and MY_RESVECTOR = 0
<li>For results with few modes included and with residual vectors, set MY_FREQUENCY = 0 and MY_RESVECTOR = 1
</ul>
By performing the above, one will see that even at the higher-frequency response, the residual vector method will give results comparable to including many modes even if the user has a smaller set of modes.  <a href=""input/resvec.xls"">An Excel spreadsheet</a> is also available, which tabulates the results (notice the difference in results for higher frequencies - this is where, without residual vector method and fewer modes, one may not accurately capture higher-frequency response).<br>
Note that the residual vector method includes stiffness of higher frequencies, but one should still have enough modes to characterize the mass of the structure (i.e., it's not a panacea for insufficient modes).  Also, use of ANSYS 11.0 or higher is required.

Generates 2-D contact (<a href=""http://ansys.net/collection/1078"">CONTAC48</a>) or 3-D contact (<a href=""http://ansys.net/collection/1079"">CONTAC49</a>) elements. Each contact element connects nodes on a target element face to a contact node. The ""target"" end of a contact element is called the contact element base. A target element face is defined as a face on a selected element whose nodes belong to the target component. If the selected element is a solid then the target face must also be external to the model, while for a line or shell element all nodes of the element will belong to the target face. The active element type attribute (TYPE) must be a contact element (CONTAC48 or CONTAC49) and must match the dimensionality of the target element. The other active attributes (MAT, TYPE, REAL, ESYS) will be used for the generated elements. The target elements must be defined before using this command. Midside nodes on target element faces are ignored.<p></p>

electric motor rotors using copper. Electric motors using copper rotors are significantly more energy
efficient relative to motors using aluminum rotors. However, one of the challenges in copper rotor die-casting is low tool
life. Experiments have shown that the higher molten metal temperature of copper (1085 Â°C), as compared to aluminum
(660 Â°C) accelerates the onset of thermal fatigue or heat checking in traditional H-13 tool steel. This happens primarily
because the mechanical properties of H-13 tool steel decrease significantly above 650 Â°C. Potential approaches to
mitigate the heat checking problem include: 1) identification of potential tool materials having better high temperature
mechanical properties than H-13, and 2) reduction of the magnitude of cyclic thermal excursions experienced by the
tooling by increasing the bulk die temperature. A preliminary assessment of alternative tool materials has led to the
selection of nickel-based alloys Haynes 230 and Inconel 617 as potential candidates. These alloys were selected based
on their elevated temperature physical and mechanical properties. Therefore, the overall objective of this research work
was to predict the number of copper rotor die-casting cycles to the onset of heat checking (tool life) as a function of bulk
die temperature (up to 650 Â°C) for Haynes 230 and Inconel 617 alloys. To achieve these goals, a 2D thermo-mechanical

<i>""In many organizations design engineers perform FEA (Finite Element Analysis) based simulations on personal desktop systems.

Moreover this approach requires high-powered desktop systems that are not shared with other users and therefore only fully utilized for relatively short periods of time. An approach, where simple simulations are run on desktop systems and more complex problems are solved on shared 'back-end' compute systems is more efficient. Due to their excellent price/performance ratio, Linux based clusters of commodity systems have become the dominating platform for these 'back-end' computations. While Linux-based clusters are a cost effective way to address the always increasing demand for compute cycles, the concept of achieving high performance through interconnected systems introduces performance and manageability challenges.

These errors can be broadly classified under the following categories: 1) user error - incorrect usage of FE software or input by the FE analyst, 2) errors due to assumptions and simplifications used in the model and 3) errors due to insufficient mesh discretization. User errors can be prevented by developing and utilizing a comprehensive pre and post processing checklist and by appropriate training in the basics of finite element analysis and usage of FE software. Errors due to modeling assumptions and simplifications can be alleviated by adding complexity to the model so that it better represents the physics of the problem being analyzed. Errors due to the inadequacy or coarseness of the mesh are often overlooked by the analyst. These errors due to mesh discretization can be fixed by evaluating the quality of the mesh and by developing and utilizing criteria that characterize the accuracy of the FE solution.

Full harmonic analyses provide exact solutions, typically calculated at equally spaced intervals over
the desired frequency range. Mode-superposition analyses, however, provide approximate solutions, but can be
clustered around potential resonant peaks. The hybrid method discussed in this article uses a modal solution to
determine natural frequencies, which are then used to calculate clusters of points surrounding those frequencies.
Full harmonic solutions can then be performed at these clustered points. Examples and input les are provided
in order to utilize this method.""</i>",1225,10,3
