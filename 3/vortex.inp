!I have attached the potion of my input file for setting up the CFD problem.
!It was a two load step run.  The first load step of 50 time steps contained
!a slight non-zero vertical velocity component, VY, to perturb the flow.
!Afterwards, VY was reset to zero as normally done.  The key to maintaining
!the shedding response in the flow is related to using the SUPG advection
!discretization scheme (2nd order spatial accuracy), as well as zeroing out
!the damping term, C2TA, in the momentum and pressure equations.
!
!Hope this helps.
