It will create an attribute set on each selected entity (the name for this is immaterial) and an attribute in that set (the name for this is what will be looked at for creating a WB side attribute). More than anything this was a proof of concept script and does not have some of the \"niceties\" one might like (e.g. just adding to an already existing attribute set instead of creating a new one, or modifying an existing value if an attribute already exists of a given name in the given set). However, this script would allow you (with multiple invocations) to create multiple attributes on a given entity. That is something that an entity naming scheme does not allow conveniently. This is particularly significant for named selections, since an entity may need to be included in several named selections (perhaps one for load, one for mesh sizing, etc.).\""

    "description": "Fictitious example of an acoustic analysis of a speaker in an archived ANSYS Workbench 13.0 project. Voice coil is excited with unit force; pressure is measured in front of speaker. \n\n  In Workbench, turn on beta features in order to be able to postprocess acoustic pressure. \n\n  Instead of performing a harmonic sweep, an analysis of a single frequency is set up. The Workbench Parameter page is then use to run a frequency sweep, where the PML (perfectly matched layers) region and buffer region size, along with mesh density, is adjusted for each frequency. This is done because if a single mesh for a large frequency range is used, the PML region would need to be as large as to accommodate the lowest frequency of interest while the mesh needs to be fine enough to capture the response of the highest frequency of interest — a large domain and small element size would result in inefficient solution times. By using Workbench Parameters, the mesh can be adjusted uniquely for each frequency. Higher-order FLUID220 and FLUID221 are used."
