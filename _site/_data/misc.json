    "description": "Fictitious example of an acoustic analysis of a speaker in an archived ANSYS Workbench 13.0 project. Voice coil is excited with unit force; pressure is measured in front of speaker. \n\n  In Workbench, turn on beta features in order to be able to postprocess acoustic pressure. \n\n  Instead of performing a harmonic sweep, an analysis of a single frequency is set up. The Workbench Parameter page is then use to run a frequency sweep, where the PML (perfectly matched layers) region and buffer region size, along with mesh density, is adjusted for each frequency. This is done because if a single mesh for a large frequency range is used, the PML region would need to be as large as to accommodate the lowest frequency of interest while the mesh needs to be fine enough to capture the response of the highest frequency of interest — a large domain and small element size would result in inefficient solution times. By using Workbench Parameters, the mesh can be adjusted uniquely for each frequency. Higher-order FLUID220 and FLUID221 are used."
