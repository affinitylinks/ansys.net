    "description": "\"Modeling bolts for three-dimensional finite element applications have, and still continue to raise questions. The limitations on model size sometimes make modeling of solid bolts impractical. Therefore, many analysts choose other methods to model bolts. Line elements with coupled nodes and line elements with spider beams are a couple of alternative approaches. This paper looks at a few methods for modeling pretension bolted joints using the finite element method (ANSYS 5.7). Pretension is modeled using ANSYS pretension elements (PRETS179) which can be used on solid or line element types. Surface-to-surface contact elements are used to account for varying contact distribution along flanges. Bolt head and nut behavior is modeled by, coupled nodes, beam elements, rigid body elements (RBE3), or solids. Bolt stud is modeled by solid elements, beam elements, pipe elements, or link elements. The choice of line elements versus solid elements is determined by the degree of complexity sought. The pros and cons of different simulations are also discussed.\""

    "description": "\"The civil engineering structures are today designed with respect to the limit state of serviceability and limit states of the strength and stability. The design of more efficient and light structures leads to the nonlinear analysis of deflections and stresses. Some parts of structure could reach the yield point under the design load. Some parts of structure could lose their local stability. These complex problems of a different nature are possible to solve by FEM methods.\""

    "description": "\"Recent advances in finite element techniques and design optimization integration technologies along with the parallel hardware and software evolution have directed the CMS group to turn its attention to utilizing \"of the shelf\" technology of achieving the same goals. Thus, the \"Z-mat\" and \"Z-Optim\" packages from Northwest Numerics, Inc., have been utilized to extract the non-linear constitutive response from the available experimental data in an integrated and automated manner and in conjunction with the ANSYS/Mechanical infrastructure. The automation lies on the fact that the process automatically generates the code of a \"USERMAT\" subroutine that it can be subsequently used with any geometry and loading specification definable within the limits of ANSYS' non-linear element library. The geometry of the single notched specimen of NRL's In Plane has been used for developing and verifying the process.\""

These elements range from simple, limited idealizations to complex and sophisticated, general purpose algorithms. FEA analysts are frequently faced with modeling situations where changing contact cannot be assumed negligible and ignored. Finding the best choices for contact elements, element options, solver, and solution options can drastically improve the model’s performance and reduce the analyst’s frustration with a contact simulation model.\""

    "description": "\"Two case studies are summarized using anisotropic plasticity and the Weibull weakest link failure model to predict the behavior of wood and wood composites. The linear elastic orthotropic model normally used for wood is shown to be insufficient for the prediction of ultimate strength in wood. Non-linear, non-recoverable behavior in compression in each of the orthogonal material directions is of particular interest in cases where localized crushing governs the load-displacement behavior of wood.\" \r\n \r\n \"The anisotropic plasticity option in ANSYS was used to predict yielding and post-yield behavior for the wood composite used in this study because yield stresses in orthogonal directions were found to be in the ratio of 1:1.2:5. A user-programmable Fortran subroutine was developed for ANSYS to carry out the failure analysis (and to calculate the volume integration of the stresses) at each load-step in post-processing. The model was verified using two cases: I) the ASTM D143 shear block test, and II) bolted connections.\""

The reliability of solder joints is one of the critical issues in BGA surface mount technology (SMT). During reliability testing, BGA fatigue failures were observed on test vehicles (TV). Finite element analysis and physical failure analysis were used to determine the risk to the product in the field. As part of this effort, parametric finite element analysis was carried out to determine the effect of design features like the package size, and BGA pattern on the propensity of fatigue failure. The results of the finite element analysis and physical failure analysis showed that the risk to fatigue failure was much greater on a peripheral / partial grid array package than in a full grid array package.\""

This model is capable of predicting the residual strength and residual stiffness of laminates with arbitrary lay-ups, geometries and bolt positions. The parametric study includes stress analysis, failure analysis and material property degradation. Stress analysis of the three-dimensional geometry was performed using the ANSYS FE code. Failure analysis and degradation of material properties were implemented using a progressive damage model, which is incorporated in an ANSYS macro-routine. The progressive model utilizes a set of stress-based Hashin-type criteria and a set of appropriate degradation rules. A parametric study was performed to examine the effect of bolt position and friction upon residual strength and damage accumulation."

A dual-end-pumped, actively cooled, fiber laser has generated >11 W CW output power at 1535 nm from only 11.9 cm of active fiber. Simulations indicate power-scaling possibilities with improved fiber and cooling designs."

    "description": "\"The analysis of gasketted flanges is now becoming an essential technique to design pressure vessels or piping, because the design code is being modified. On the other hand, the gasket has an extreme nonlinearity which causes the analysis to be very difficult, especially using linear material properties. A finite element analysis program other than ANSYS has the element library for gasket element, but ANSYS does not have it yet.\" \r\n \r\n \"The authors developed a method to model this nonlinear gasket by using the elements available in ANSYS Rel. 5.5 for 2-dimensional axisymmetric analysis and those in Rel. 5.6 for 3-dimensional analysis. In this paper, the concept and the procedure of the modeling is introduced. The data input is possible using a template, without using any other ANSYS commands. The whole analysis execution is controlled by APDL.\" \r\n \r\n [STI: Gasket elements are available from version 6.1 onwards, after this paper was written]"

The approach is based on the approximating generalized models of subdomains that leads to a considerably fewer number of iterations requiring updating of substructure parameters. The analytical proof of the convergence of the theoretical iterative procedure and the demonstration of convergence of its numerical implementation with the help of ANSYS are presented.\""

The user can review the contents of the two input files and see how one can relate harmonic analyses (the transfer function) to the response PSD in random vibration analyses. (Actually, one can also look it up in any dynamics textbook, but this just shows how one can do it in ANSYS.) \r\n \r\n (See also TFUN undocumented command to get the transfer function after a random vibration analysis.)"

    "description": "This is a very simple example using Workbench Mechanical 12.0.1 to demonstrate use of the INISTATE command in defining initial stress. \r\n Open Workbench 12.0.1 (or 12.1) and use \"File > Restore Archive ...\" and select the zip file to open the model. Solving should take less than a minute. \r\n  The model is a simple bar. The first analysis branch has 10e3 psi initial stress only in the x-direction. Notice that the block is free to expand - it only has symmetry boundary conditions. The final results show basically zero stress and displacement of -8.1455e-4 inches. Since initial stress is 10e3 and elastic modulus is 29e6 with a length of 2.3622 inches: \r\n 10e3 / 29e6 * 2.3622 = 8.1455e-4 \r\n which is the same answer as given by ANSYS. \r\n \r\n The second analysis branch also has 10e3 psi initial stress only in x-direction. However, there is a Frictionless Support preventing the block from expanding. Final results show displacement basically of zero, and stress of 10e3 psi. This is because the initial stress cannot relax due to the boundary conditions, so the final stress = initial stress in this particular case."
