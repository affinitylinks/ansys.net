    "author": "Chandresh Shah",

    "description": "\"Any finite element analysis performed by an engineer is subject to several types of errors that can compromise the validity of the results. These errors can be broadly classified under the following categories: 1) user error - incorrect usage of FE software or input by the FE analyst, 2) errors due to assumptions and simplifications used in the model and 3) errors due to insufficient mesh discretization. User errors can be prevented by developing and utilizing a comprehensive pre and post processing checklist and by appropriate training in the basics of finite element analysis and usage of FE software. Errors due to modeling assumptions and simplifications can be alleviated by adding complexity to the model so that it better represents the physics of the problem being analyzed. Errors due to the inadequacy or coarseness of the mesh are often overlooked by the analyst. These errors due to mesh discretization can be fixed by evaluating the quality of the mesh and by developing and utilizing criteria that characterize the accuracy of the FE solution. This paper describes the source of mesh discretization error and presents several criteria that can be used by an FE analyst to evaluate the accuracy of the FE solution.\"\n\n[ANSYS 5.7, 2002 Conference] "

The linear elastic orthotropic model normally used for wood is shown to be insufficient for the prediction of ultimate strength in wood. Non-linear, non-recoverable behavior in compression in each of the orthogonal material directions is of particular interest in cases where localized crushing governs the load-displacement behavior of wood.\"\r\n \r\n \"The anisotropic plasticity option in ANSYS was used to predict yielding and post-yield behavior for the wood composite used in this study because yield stresses in orthogonal directions were found to be in the ratio of 1:1.2:5. A user-programmable Fortran subroutine was developed for ANSYS to carry out the failure analysis (and to calculate the volume integration of the stresses) at each load-step in post-processing. The model was verified using two cases: I) the ASTM D143 shear block test, and II) bolted connections.\""

The reliability of solder joints is one of the critical issues in BGA surface mount technology (SMT). During reliability testing, BGA fatigue failures were observed on test vehicles (TV). Finite element analysis and physical failure analysis were used to determine the risk to the product in the field. As part of this effort, parametric finite element analysis was carried out to determine the effect of design features like the package size, and BGA pattern on the propensity of fatigue failure. The results of the finite element analysis and physical failure analysis showed that the risk to fatigue failure was much greater on a peripheral / partial grid array package than in a full grid array package.\""

Failure analysis and degradation of material properties were implemented using a progressive damage model, which is incorporated in an ANSYS macro-routine. The progressive model utilizes a set of stress-based Hashin-type criteria and a set of appropriate degradation rules.

The automation lies on the fact that the process automatically generates the code of a \"USERMAT\"subroutine that it can be subsequently used with any geometry and loading specification definable within the limits of ANSYS' non-linear element library. The geometry of the single notched specimen of NRL's In Plane has been used for developing and verifying the process.\""

    "description": "\"I recently experimented with coupling ANSYS and DAKOTA, and thought the list might be interested in the results. DAKOTA, if you're not familiar with it, is a public-domain optimization code available from Sandia National Laboratories (see http://endo.sandia.gov/DAKOTA/). It has several advanced optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms), supports discrete variables, and has several other features that make it a nice complement to the optimization and probabilistic design modules within ANSYS. And it's FREE.\n\n\"Anyways, the procedure for using DAKOTA with ANSYS consists of creating a DAKOTA input file (DAKOTA in the attachments) that identifies the design variables, state variables, optimization method, etc. Also, within this file you identify the command to be issued to execute the code you are using to generate the response variables (analysis_driver = 'ansys.prl', in the attached example). To execute ANSYS I use an intermediate Perl script (ansys.prl) that translates the design variable file generated by DAKOTA (parameters_file = 'dakota.dv') into something ANSYS can understand (written out to ansys.dv). The Perl script then executes ANSYS. Note that the Perl script is general purpose -- it should work for any application. The only thing you should need to change is filenames, in particular the name of your ANSYS script (in my example, 'ANSYS'). The ANSYS script reads in the design variable file using /INPUT, performs the analysis, then outputs the result variables to a file (results_file = 'dakota.rv') using *CFOPEN and *VWRITE.\n\n\"To execute the analysis you use (for example) the command line: dakota -i DAKOTA > dakota.log &\n\n\"That's pretty much it. Pretty straightforward once you figure out the DAKOTA input file syntax. The attached example is the simple beam optimization problem used in the ANSYS documentation.\""

The better the knowledge of the leading physical effects in a complex system, the simpler and more cost-efficient the analytical model can be. Moreover, the understanding of the most important physical driving effects often enables one to build a simplified, closed-form mathematical effective model. Such models usually give insight into the interplay of various parameters governing the physical behavior of the complex system. In this way, a fast pre-optimization of the desired features is often possible. Subsequently, the rich arsenal of ANSYS multiphysics capabilities can be used to refine the judgements and obtain the desired quantitative solutions.\""

There are 3 macros contained in the zip file: GRPH2SVG.MAC is the main one, and the other two are called by GRPH2SVG.\n\n The macro redirects the plot to an ANSYS Graphics file \"stiplot.grph\". Then, the macro parses through the GRPH file and generates an SVG file called \"stiplot.svg\". You can change the font, font size, etc. as you see fit from within the macro. (For details on the contents of the GRPH file, refer to the ANSYS Programmer's Guide for details.)\n\nBecause this parses the GRPH file from within ANSYS, it is slow for complex plots, so I recommend using it only for XY plots â this is only meant to serve as an example of what can be done with APDL and reading the GRPH file contents. Also, I did not bother including support for raster graphics - this macro only supports vector graphics. (If you want raster graphics, use of PNG is better. SVG is really a vector graphics implementation.)\n\nIf you're running Firefox, or if you use Internet Explorer and have the Adobe SVG Viewer Plug-in, you can see a sample contour plot and sample XY plot generated from this macro.\n\nBecause this was created by hand, there may be mistakes - you can let me know if you encounter any. Otherwise, instead of using this macro, you can create an EPS file and use your favorite illustration software to convert it to an SVG file."

Since initial stress is 10e3 and elastic modulus is 29e6 with a length of 2.3622 inches: \r\n 10e3 / 29e6 * 2.3622 = 8.1455e-4 \r\n which is the same answer as given by ANSYS. \r\n \r\n The second analysis branch also has 10e3 psi initial stress only in x-direction.

    "description": "\"Modeling bolts for three-dimensional finite element applications have, and still continue to raise questions. The limitations on model size sometimes make modeling of solid bolts impractical. Therefore, many analysts choose other methods to model bolts. Line elements with coupled nodes and line elements with spider beams are a couple of alternative approaches. This paper looks at a few methods for modeling pretension bolted joints using the finite element method (ANSYS 5.7). Pretension is modeled using ANSYS pretension elements (PRETS179) which can be used on solid or line element types. Surface-to-surface contact elements are used to account for varying contact distribution along flanges. Bolt head and nut behavior is modeled by, coupled nodes, beam elements, rigid body elements (RBE3), or solids. Bolt stud is modeled by solid elements, beam elements, pipe elements, or link elements. The choice of line elements versus solid elements is determined by the degree of complexity sought. The pros and cons of different simulations are also discussed.\""

    "description": "\"The modeling of diesel engine cylinder head gasket joints is complicated by the nonlinear response of the head gasketâs materials. Linearization of these material responses can lead to significant errors in the solutionâs results. The 1-dimensional nonlinear approximation made by the Gasket material option of the SOLID185 element sufficiently captures the response of the nonlinear gasket materials while maintaining practical solution times for the large model sizes associated with multi-cylinder head gasket joint models. This paper will give an overview of the model building and assembly process used to create a head gasket joint model, describe the nonlinear nature of the materials used in the model, and present comparisons of the modelâs results with experimental measurements.\"\n\n[STI: There is a gasket-specific material & element in 6.1, not available at the time of the writing]"

    "description": "\"This paper presents the shape optimization of an automotive universal joint, by simultaneously considering manufacturing cost, maximum drivable joint angle and part volume. Comprised of three main components - two yokes and a cross trunnion - a universal joint is a linkage used to transmit rotational motion from one shaft to another when the axes are coplanar, but not coinciding. In this research, universal joint designs are analyzed and compared using a weighted sum of three objective functions: minimization of machining cost, maximization of adjoining shaft joint angle, and minimization of total part volume. Part modeling and analysis is conducted using the Finite Element Analysis package ANSYS and optimization is implemented using MATLAB. The results show Pareto frontiers for both the flange and weld yoke, constructed using the Adaptive Weighted Sum technique. These frontiers clearly illustrate the trade-off between machining cost and joint angle; that is, to increase the joint angle, a corresponding increase in the cost of the part is required. It has been shown that maximization of driveable joint angle requires a simultaneous increase in machining cost of 4.4% and 2.7% for the flange and weld yoke, respectively.\"\n[ANSYS Structural, version 9.0]"

These tools, which include a 126-segment sweating manikin, a finite element physiological model of the human body, and a psychological model based on human subject testing, are designed to predict human thermal comfort in transient nonuniform thermal environments such as automobiles. The manikin measures the heat loss from the human body in the vehicle environment and sends the heat flux from each segment to the physiological model. The physiological model predicts the bodyâs response to the environment, determines 126 segment skin temperatures, sweat rates, and breathing rate, and transmits the data to the manikin. The psychological model uses temperature data from the physiological model to predict the local and global thermal comfort as a function of local skin and core temperatures and their rates of change. Results of initial integration testing show the thermal response of a manikin segment to transient environmental conditions.\"\n\n[ANSYS Thermal, version unknown]"
