[An Excel spreadsheet](https://github.com/affinitylinks/ansys.net/blob/main/10/resvec.xls) is also available, which tabulates the results (notice the difference in results for higher frequencies - this is where, without residual vector method and fewer modes, one may not accurately capture higher-frequency response). \n  Note that the residual vector method includes stiffness of higher frequencies, but one should still have enough modes to characterize the mass of the structure (i.e., it's not a panacea for insufficient modes).
