[An Excel spreadsheet](https://github.com/affinitylinks/ansys.net/blob/main/10/resvec.xls) is also available, which tabulates the results (notice the difference in results for higher frequencies - this is where, without residual vector method and fewer modes, one may not accurately capture higher-frequency response). \n  Note that the residual vector method includes stiffness of higher frequencies, but one should still have enough modes to characterize the mass of the structure (i.e., it's not a panacea for insufficient modes).

As far as the temperature-dependent moisture diffusion, alternating between moisture mechanics and thermal mechanics can probably be done by updating material properties.\" \n\n (Csat is saturated moisture concentration and D is diffusion coefficient.) \n\n  \"We use this analogy to simulate moisture absorption in multi-material semiconductor packages under various temperature and RH conditions. It works quite well. Ee Hua Wong (Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore) has developed the technique using ANSYS/Thermal simulations. Mr. Wong has produced several papers outlining the technique.\""
