As an example, the 3rd value listed in a common block is at position 3 (or index 3).\n\n The way you use a common block is you look in the ansys/custom/include directory for the value you want to know.\n In this case I did a search for a file that contained \"/cplane\"and found it in d3com.inc.\n Looking in the file I found that the value kycpln is what I was looking for and the common block was /d3com/\n Sometimes you can just count to find out what the index is, but this block is huge and has arrays in it. So instead, I used the macro below.\n\n I did:\n\n /cplane,0\n cmndif,0,'d3com',0\n /cplane,1\n cmndif,1,'d3com',0\n\n And the macro wrote:\n\nFound: 91 0 1.\n\n So I would then do: *GET,_cpstat,COMMON,,D3COM,,int,91 to retrieve the value.\n\n Another example would be if I wanted to know what the global minimum and max number of divisions per line was (DESIZE):\n\n desize,10,11\n cmndif,0,'cfprp7',0\n desize,20,21\n cmndif,1,'cfprp7',0\n\n Yields:\n Found: 99 10 20.\n Found: 100 11 21.\n\n For this I would use:\n *get,_mnlnsz,common,,cfprp7,,int,99\n *get,_mxlnsz,common,,cfprp7,,int,100\""

The way to do the coupling is to create the surf152 elements first, using esurf. Select the solid elements over which the 152's will be overlaid, and select the nodes on the surfaces of the solid elements where you want the 152's to be created. Set the type, mat, and real. Change keyopt 5 to 0 (no extra node) - this will be changed back to 1 by the macro. Then just issue the esurf command, with nothing after it (no extra node assignment). Now you are almost ready to run the macro! Just select the NODES of the fluid116 elements and the surf152 ELEMENTS. An easy way to do this in your model would be:\n\nesel,s,type,,9\nnsle\nesel,s,type,,8\n\nNow run the macro, it will automatically map the closes fluid node to each surf152 element to be the extra node for that element. It may take a while if you have a large number of 116s and 152s, so just be patient. You won't get any feedback while it is running.\""

I have since been working on a skin depth macro myself. I now have a first working beta\". It is currently pretty crude since I'm relatively new to ANSYS, my geometry is pretty simple and the expansion algorithm I worked out is very simple. It will only mesh a line of rectangular prisms oriented with the current coordinate system. The end result is something similar to what a straight VSWEEP command could accomplish but with the difference that the user can specify exactly the thickness of the skin depth (or boundary layer if it suits) and how many layers of mesh should be contained in that skin depth. Suits my purposes for now so I thought that maybe somebody else might find a use as well. There are actually three macros: skin.mac - the main macro, and sorter.mac and picker.mac that are called from the main macro. The other caveat I guess is to mention that I wrote them for Ansys 5.5 and so some of the command names may be changed or obsolete (which includes jumping to a label which was already technically obsolete in 5.5) in newer versions.\"\n\"I posted some skin depth meshing macros to the Ansys egroup that you reproduced on your ansys.net page. Since then I have updated the macros significantly to make them more usable and a lot less buggy. The macro is now able to mesh full planes of rectangular prisms, instead of just a line of prisms. With the use of an extra coordinate system I use it to expand the mesh in both directions away from the surface of interest. The macros are now updated to Ansys version 5.6 as well (and in fact won't work in 5.5 due to VSWEEP no longer requiring source and target areas). Just thought I would send the new improved versions to save frustration if anyone ever uses them.\""

At the moment the script is written to export 2D arrays of MxN (don't need to specify the dimensions). The output file contains the data i,j,data(i,j) where i and j are the array indices. The usage of the macro is:\nwritearr,'array','filename','ext'\"\n\nHere is the companion MATLAB script:\nREADANSYSARRAY\n\n\"This is the second part of the script, which uses the file exported by writearr.mac. This matlab script will import the file, and reshape the matrix into the correct format. The function is used as follows:\n1. load the file into MATLAB: load press.txt\n 2. convert the matrix into the correct format: press2=readansysarray(press);\""
