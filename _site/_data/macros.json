As an example, the 3rd value listed in a common block is at position 3 (or index 3).\n\n The way you use a common block is you look in the ansys/custom/include directory for the value you want to know.\n In this case I did a search for a file that contained \"/cplane\" and found it in d3com.inc.\n Looking in the file I found that the value kycpln is what I was looking for and the common block was /d3com/\n Sometimes you can just count to find out what the index is, but this block is huge and has arrays in it. So instead, I used the macro below.\n\n I did:\n\n /cplane,0\n cmndif,0,'d3com',0\n /cplane,1\n cmndif,1,'d3com',0\n\n And the macro wrote:\n\nFound: 91 0 1.\n\n So I would then do: *GET,_cpstat,COMMON,,D3COM,,int,91 to retrieve the value.\n\n Another example would be if I wanted to know what the global minimum and max number of divisions per line was (DESIZE):\n\n desize,10,11\n cmndif,0,'cfprp7',0\n desize,20,21\n cmndif,1,'cfprp7',0\n\n Yields:\n Found: 99 10 20.\n Found: 100 11 21.\n\n For this I would use:\n *get,_mnlnsz,common,,cfprp7,,int,99\n *get,_mxlnsz,common,,cfprp7,,int,100\""

The top row of the array starting at the second column contains selected node numbers. The second row starting at the second column contains GRMS values at each node. Starting in the third row, the first column is filled with frequency breakpoints; the second column over contains output PSD data for each of the selected nodes.\"\n\nThis can be used as an example of writing output to a file."

The result is only pseudo-random because with the same seed value you will always end up with the same \"random\" number. So whenever you start ANSYS it initializes the seed value. If you start generating random numbers then you will always get the same sequence of \"random\" numbers. The solution to this problem is to randomize the seed value itself using the system-time. Enclosed is the macro \"randseed\" that will exactly do that. You will get \"real\" random numbers after you run \"randseed\". You might want to run this macro every time before you start with your random number generation. You can also include the macro in your \"start.ans\" procedure so it will be executed each time you start ANSYS.\"\nIt effectively randomizes the seed by executing the RAND an arbitrary number of times."
