## Documentation on UIDL

The UIDL Programmer's Guide is part of the ANSYS Programmer's Set manuals. It is available in hardcopy only, so you should ask your local ASD to purchase this set of manuals (also includes APDL, UPFs, and Interface guides)

Otherwise, you can use the ANSYS 10.0 PDF version of the UIDL Programmer's Guide accessible from the ANSYS Customer Portal.

## Use of UVB (Uidl Visual Builder)

Although it was never officially released, the UVB (Uidl Visual Builder) is a Tcl/Tk-based, useful tool to help in developing UIDL granule files for custom menus and dialog boxes. You can get the various files from here (they are no longer available on the ANSYS FTP site). This zip file contains files you can install and configure to get UVB up-and-running.

Please remember that UVB is unsupported and use-at-your-own-risk. However, with the UIDL Programmer's Guide mentioned above, these two tools help users greatly in developing their own interfaces for ANSYS.

## Tcl/Tk as an alternative

Also, please note that [Tcl/Tk](/html/tcl/) is also used for ANSYS customization.
