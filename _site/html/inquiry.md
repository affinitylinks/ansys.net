Here is just about everything I know about inquiry functions. They are similar to \*GET functions in usage, and have two input arguments. Here's an example.

a=ndinqr(33,1)

In this case, "a" will be assigned a value of -1 if node 33 is unselected, 0 if it is undefined, and 1 if it is selected. This is an example of using an inquiry function to obtain information about a specific entity, in this case node 33.

An alternative use of an inquiry function is to find more generic data about a certain kind of entities. The following example illustrates this.

a=ndinqr(0,14)

This will assign to parameter "a" the highest node number defined in the model. Notice that the first argument is zero, and the second argument is 14.

Here are the inquiry functions I am aware of.

ndinqr(node,key) node number or zero, and key number
elmiqr(elem,key)
kpinqr(keypoint,key)
lsinqr(line,key)
arinqr(area,key)
vlinqr(volume,key)
rlinqr(real,key)
gapiqr(gap element,key)
masiqr(master DOF,key)
ceinqr(constraint equation,key)
cpinqr(coupled set,key)
csyiqr(coord system,key)
etyiqr(element type,key)
foriqr(nodal force,key)

All of these work pretty much the same, with the first argument used as either an entity ID number (for data about a specific node, element, etc.) or a zero if the information is about a class of element (number of selected nodes, etc.)

The key numbers are defined as follows.

key=1 return select status (for a specific entity)
key=12 return number of defined entities (KP's, nodes, etc.)
key=13 return number of selected entities
key=14 return the highest ID number in use

There a few other inquiry functions which have a slightly different format.

mpinqr(mat,prop,key) material property table number, property number, key additional key=3 for number of temps used in a specific property

dget(node,idof,kcmplx) node number, displacement pointer, complex key displacement pointers are...
1=ux, 2=uy, 3=uz, 4=rotx, 5=roty, 6=rotz, 7=ax, 8=ay 9=az, 10=vx, 11=vy, 12=vz, 19=pres, 20=temp, 21=volt, 22=mag, 23=enke, 24=ends, 25=emf, 26=curr
complex key=0 for real, 1 for imaginary

fget(node,idof,kcomplx) same definition as dget, but for forces this time.

Inquiry Functions for Sections
I have looked at the code and can confirm Tyllinen Juha's observation. It will work in 5.5, 5.6, and not likely to change.

"Quick testing seems to indicate that Section number would be available with sn = elmiqr(n,-4), where n is the element number. At least that is the way it worked in 5.5.1 with Beam188 and Beam189."

Other possibilites for element characteristics
-1, material number
-2, element type
-3, real constant number
-4, Element Section ID number
-5, coordinate system number

Inquiry Function for Next Available Number
I've discovered that **inqr(0,16) or \***iqr(0,16) returns the next available number. For example, if areas 1, 2, and 3 exist in the model, then arinqr(0,16) returns a value of 4. However, if only areas 2 and 3 exist in the model, then arinqr(0,16) returns a value of 1.

Number of line loops in area
Area Line Loops
arliqr(areaid,loopid,key)
areaid - area for inquiry
loopid – loop number
key – 1 for number of loops when loopid is zero, or 2 for number of lines in loopid
e.g.: arliqr(53,0,1) = number of loops in area 53
arliqr(53,1,2) = number of lines in loop 1 of area 53
arliqr(53,2,2) = number of lines in loop 2 of area 53
arliqr(53,3,2) = number of lines in loop 3 of area 53
```
