<p class="font-italic">Chandresh Shah</p>
<p>&quot;Any finite element analysis performed by an engineer is subject to several types of errors that can compromise the validity of the results. These errors can be broadly classified under the following categories: 1) user error - incorrect usage of FE software or input by the FE analyst, 2) errors due to assumptions and simplifications used in the model and 3) errors due to insufficient mesh discretization. User errors can be prevented by developing and utilizing a comprehensive pre and post processing checklist and by appropriate training in the basics of finite element analysis and usage of FE software. Errors due to modeling assumptions and simplifications can be alleviated by adding complexity to the model so that it better represents the physics of the problem being analyzed. Errors due to the inadequacy or coarseness of the mesh are often overlooked by the analyst. These errors due to mesh discretization can be fixed by evaluating the quality of the mesh and by developing and utilizing criteria that characterize the accuracy of the FE solution. This paper describes the source of mesh discretization error and presents several criteria that can be used by an FE analyst to evaluate the accuracy of the FE solution.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Jerome Montgomery</p>
<p>&quot;Modeling bolts for three-dimensional finite element applications have, and still continue to raise questions. The limitations on model size sometimes make modeling of solid bolts impractical. Therefore, many analysts choose other methods to model bolts. Line elements with coupled nodes and line elements with spider beams are a couple of alternative approaches. This paper looks at a few methods for modeling pretension bolted joints using the finite element method (ANSYS 5.7). Pretension is modeled using ANSYS pretension elements (PRETS179) which can be used on solid or line element types. Surface-to-surface contact elements are used to account for varying contact distribution along flanges. Bolt head and nut behavior is modeled by, coupled nodes, beam elements, rigid body elements (RBE3), or solids. Bolt stud is modeled by solid elements, beam elements, pipe elements, or link elements. The choice of line elements versus solid elements is determined by the degree of complexity sought. The pros and cons of different simulations are also discussed.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Jonathan Raub</p>
<p>&quot;The modeling of diesel engine cylinder head gasket joints is complicated by the nonlinear response of the head gasket’s materials. Linearization of these material responses can lead to significant errors in the solution’s results. The 1-dimensional nonlinear approximation made by the Gasket material option of the SOLID185 element sufficiently captures the response of the nonlinear gasket materials while maintaining practical solution times for the large model sizes associated with multi-cylinder head gasket joint models. This paper will give an overview of the model building and assembly process used to create a head gasket joint model, describe the nonlinear nature of the materials used in the model, and present comparisons of the model’s results with experimental measurements.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Tae Hee Lee, Kwangki Lee, Kwang Soon Lee</p>
<p>&quot;The ultimate goal of simulation that represents the behaviour of structures is to optimize their response performances within the specific requirements and needs with respect to the design variables. The first step of the design of cathode ray tubes is to design the glass geometry, called funnel geometry, to endure the vacuum stress because it is a main structure of cathode ray tubes. In order to create 3-dimensional funnel geometry in the cathode ray tubes, higher order response surface model is used instead of NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines) or Bezier curve because it is more robust for understanding the geometry change in finite element analysis. By combining finite element analysis, response surface model and sequential quadratic programming within the process integration framework, the shape optimization of a funnel is successfully performed and the maximum stress is reduced to almost half of the current one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A macro file is a file which contains Ansys commands. If you save your macro in your working directory or in the macro directory (see /PSEARCH command) you just enter the macro name in the command line and all these commands will be executed. You can even nest macros: from your main file you call e.g. zzmacro1 which again calls zzmacro2. The only problem is that a macro could change - and you would probably not notice that - the value of a parameter you are using in your main input file. This will be the case if the same parameter name is used accidentally in both the macro and your main input. Let's see how one can avoid these nasty errors - just click on the link!&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">J.M. Gerard, J. Ohayon, V. Luboz, P. Perrier, Y. Paya</p>
<p>&quot;This paper aims at characterizing the mechanical behavior of two human anatomical structures, namely the tongue and the cheek. For this, an indentation experiment was provided, by measuring the mechanical response of tongue and cheek tissues removed from the fresh cadaver of a 74 year old woman. Non-linear relationships were observed between the force applied to the tissues and the corresponding displacements. To infer the mechanical constitutive laws from these measurements, a finite element (FE) analysis was provided. This analysis aimed at simulating the indentation experiment. An optimization process was used to determine the FE constitutive laws that provided the non-linear force/displacements observed during the indentation experiments. The tongue constitutive law was used for simulations provided by a 3D FE biomechanical model of the human tongue. This dynamical model was designed to study speech production. Given a set of tongue muscular commands, which levels correspond to the force classically measured during speech production, the FE model successfully simulated the main tongue movements observed during speech data.&quot;<br>

As a result of tests carried out for several fatigue criteria, the Dang Van hypothesis was used for the detailed numerical study. A way of respective adapting the high-cycle load history was also suggested. The complete algorithm of the fatigue optimization was illustrated by applying the proposed procedures to vehicle parts which are subject to high-cycle loadings.

<p class="font-italic">Karen L. Troy and Mark D. Grabiner</p>
<p>&quot;Distal radius fractures are among the most common fall-related injuries in older women. Numerous studies have quantified upper extremity fall biomechanics with the goal of identifying possible interventions to reduce the peak force on the wrists, thereby reducing the number of fractures. Fracture initiation depends both on the force applied to the bone and upon the strength of the bone itself; thus, poor bone quality has been implicated as a factor in distal radius fractures. Generally, an intervention to improve bone quality (such as antiresorptive therapy) is considered successful if bone mineral density (BMD) can be increased by 2-4%.<br>
Cadaver and finite element studies have previously quantified the force required to cause a distal radius fracture. To date, however, only simple axial loads on the radius have been considered. Because most falls onto the hands result in off-axis loads, we considered the possibility that a combination of loading modes would significantly influence the fracture strength of the distal radius. Here, we used a validated finite element model of the distal radius, scaphoid, and lunate, to explore the effects of loading direction and changes in BMD on predicted fracture strength.&quot;<br>

You do NOT type in the extensions, they are default. For example, you would type pow2mat 7 nodelist nodelist which would extract 7 columns from the file nodelist.val and write a stripped file called nodelist.txt . If you have several files to convert, you can use the DOS FOR command as follows:<br>

<p>&quot;I have written a macro that calculates the total force along the three axes from applied pressure. I find this macro to be useful just to make sure that the pressure I'm applying on a curved surface is accurate and also it gives a feel for the mesh discretization where the pressure is applied. The user has to basically identify the elements with a particular magnitude of pressure and save the list file (SFELIS.lis). The macro does everything else automatically. The downside to the macro is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right now it only handles 10 node tet elements.</li>
<li>The pressure has to be uniform<br>
The user will have to modify some of the fields in the macro as well as the c-shell file prescalc.&quot;</li>

<p>&quot;A very common use of PSD analyses is to look at the response of a system under a single base excitation, such as the case with many aerospace and civil applications. The default PSD settings are very general in nature and may consequently be inefficient for such a situation. This memo hopes to outline some ways in which the user may obtain more efficient PSD solutions for the specific instance of single base excitation with relatively flat spectrum (although some techniques may be extrapolated for other cases).&quot;…An older doc I recently reanimated and updated…</p>

<p>&quot;PSD, or random vibration, analyses present some interesting challenges in postprocessing due to the nature of the assumptions related to the analysis. This memo hopes to address some of these items, including evaluation of derived stresses and calculation of response power spectral density.&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;PSD users may wish to determine the relative 1-sigma results between two points. This memo covers three methods to perform this operation, in hopes that it will give users more familiarity with PSD postprocessing in ANSYS.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">A. Mohsen, D. J. Siddall, P. Gillespie, S. Julian and M. J. Fagan </p>
<p>&quot;This research project is aimed at evaluating the feasibility of the modelling technique through the development of an artificial validation spine. The validation spine will be tested under controlled laboratory conditions and the results used to verify those found from analysis of the computer model. The intervertebral disc is the most critical component in the spine. Thus, the initial aim of this research was to develop a representative artificial disc. Concurrent development of a finite element model of the disc permits development theories to be analysed and laboratory results to be verified.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In many non-standard engineering development applications it strongly pays off to invest an effort into understanding the physics of the problem prior to undertaking complex numerical simulations. The better the knowledge of the leading physical effects in a complex system, the simpler and more cost-efficient the analytical model can be. Moreover, the understanding of the most important physical driving effects often enables one to build a simplified, closed-form mathematical effective model. Such models usually give insight into the interplay of various parameters governing the physical behavior of the complex system. In this way, a fast pre-optimization of the desired features is often possible. Subsequently, the rich arsenal of ANSYS multiphysics capabilities can be used to refine the judgements and obtain the desired quantitative solutions.&quot;</p>
