<p class="font-italic">Wei Tan (Georgia Institute of Technology)</p>
<p>&quot;The effect of PWB warpage on the low cycle fatigue of the solder bumps on board assemblies was investigated using FEM and experimental study. The three- dimensional (3-D) models of PWBAs with varying board warpage were used to estimate the solder bump fatigue life for different types of plastic ball grid array (PBGA) packages mounted on PWBs. In order to improve the accuracy of FE results, the projection moiré technique was used to measure the initial warpage of PWBs, and this warpage was used as a geometric input to the FEM. Both Sn-Pb and lead-free solder materials were used in this study. The simulation results were validated and correlated with the experimental results obtained using the projection moiré system and accelerated thermal cycling tests. Design of experiments and an advanced prediction model were generated to predict board level solder bump fatigue life based on the initial PWB warpage, package dimensions and locations, and solder bump materials.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;ANSYS has been used to compute eddy current loads in C-Mod antenna components due to a disruption. The antennas are on the outbuard mid-plane, away from the direct involvement with halo currents, which characterize loading in the inner divertor and wall. Only inductively driven currents are computed. A rather complex but manageable electromagnetic model is used. Three of the antennas used in C-Mod were analyzed, Lower Hybrid, ICRH, and MHD antennas. The goal of these simulations was principally to quantify upper bound disruption loads.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A series of blast-resist-door were used widely. In order to know the behavior of the doors under blast load and verify the safety of the doors, dynamic finite element analysis and simulation are carried out with advanced FEA software, ANSYS/LS-DYNA and SAP. Contact surfaces are introduced to simulate the relation between the door leaf and doorframe, as well as the relation between the door hinges and bearings. Altogether 24 different load cases are analyzed to simulate various load conditions.&quot;<br>

<p class="font-italic">F. Kirsch, B. Plaßmann, T. Huch, W. Rodatz</p>
<p>&quot;In April 1999 the construction of a new quay wall in the port of Hamburg started. In a first stage two new berths with an overall length of 1400 m will be built. In order to proof the bearing capacity of the foundation dynamic pile testing is performed to a great extent. To date more than thirty different piles were tested by the Institute for Foundation Engineering and Soil Mechanics of the Technical University of Braunschweig. In order to check for possible set-up effects redriven tests were performed. For comparison reasons static load tests were also carried out, one of which was done with an instrumented pile to allow skin friction and end bearing to be evaluated separately. The CAPWAP results proofed to be very helpful especially in those cases where the testing situation differed from the later service condition. Special questions called for detailed finite element analysis of the load-settlement behaviour of single piles in certain construction stages.&quot;<br>
Although ANSYS is not explicitly mentioned, F. Kirsch also used ANSYS in two related papers, Stability of the vault developing over Soilcrete bodies and Ground Improvement and Its Numerical Analysis.</p>

<p class="font-italic">Biju Chandran, Deepak Goyal, and Jeffrey Thomas</p>
<p>&quot;Ball Grid Array (BGA) is currently the interconnect of choice for attaching microprocessors on a printed circuit board (PCB). The reliability of solder joints is one of the critical issues in BGA surface mount technology (SMT). During reliability testing, BGA fatigue failures were observed on test vehicles (TV). Finite element analysis and physical failure analysis were used to determine the risk to the product in the field. As part of this effort, parametric finite element analysis was carried out to determine the effect of design features like the package size, and BGA pattern on the propensity of fatigue failure. The results of the finite element analysis and physical failure analysis showed that the risk to fatigue failure was much greater on a peripheral / partial grid array package than in a full grid array package.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Robert Darveaux</p>
<p>&quot;A generalized solder joint fatigue life model for surface mount packages was previously published in Refs [1,2]. The model is based on correlation to measured crack growth data on BGA joints during thermal cycling. It was subsequently discovered by Anderson <a href="http://et.al" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">et.al</a>. that the ANSYS TM 5.2 finite element code used in the model had an error in its method for calculating plastic work [3]. It was shown that significant error in life prediction could result by using a recent version of the code where the bug has been fixed. The error comes about since the original crack growth constants were derived based on plastic work calculations that had the bug.<br>
In this paper, crack initiation and growth constants are re-calculated using ANSYS 5.6. In addition, several other model related issues are explored with respect to the crack growth correlations. For example, 3D slice models were compared to quarter symmetry models. Anand’s constitutive model was compared with Darveaux’s constitutive model. It was shown that the crack growth rate dependence on strain energy density always had an exponent of 1.10 +/- 0.15. This is in the range of the original correlation, so the accuracy of relative predictions should still be within +/- 25%. However, the accuracy of absolute predictions could be off by a factor of 7 in the worst case, if the analyst uses a modeling procedure that is not consistent with that used for the crack growth correlation. The key to good accuracy is to maintain consistency in the modeling procedure.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">He Liu, Daniel H. Schubert</p>
<p>&quot;To explore the effects large deformation and nonlinear material properties have on the seismic response of fluid/tank systems, the computer program ANSYS was selected to develop a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model of a ground level, cylindrical steel shell and roof tank structure with contained fluid under seismic load. The ANSYS program was selected for its ability to include shell and structural steel elements, contained fluid elements, fluid-structure interactions, material and geometric nonlinearities, and contact type elements. For purposes of this study, analysis results from a linear elastic, small deformation fixed base model are compared with an elasto-plastic material property model with large deformation assumptions. Results show the significant difference in results based on the assumptions used and indicate that current design code based values may not be conservative in resultant loading calculations.&quot;</p>

Methods for preparing imported geometry from solid modeling programs are discussed, and meshing techniques are suggested. A study of mesh density is presented, comparing mesh size with heat flux and Q factor convergence. The general analysis protocol is presented in a stepwise fashion, describing the macros that are used for conducting RF calculations. Finally, these techniques are applied to a proposed RF cavity for the NLC damping rings, which is shown as an example.&quot;</p>

It is a high-performing computing tool that offers several modifications, making it possible to create a new element and adjust the calculation to individual requirements. When dealing with specific problems relating to the contact between the foundation and the foundation soil, it is possible to create an element that will take into account the behaviour of a soil layer under the foundation exposed to shear. The shearing load can be caused by undermining, concrete creep, or concrete shrinkage.&quot;<br>

<p class="font-italic">William D. O’Brien, Jr. and Yuhui Liu</p>
<p>&quot;The overall goal has been to develop an acoustic wave propagation model using well-understood and documented computational techniques that track and quantify an air-borne incident acoustic wave propagated around, into and in the human head. This model serves as a computational tool to elucidate the acoustic wave propagation around, into and in the human head. Specifically, the model determines two features: (1) alternate acoustic propagation paths to the cochlear shell that exist besides the normal air-borne acoustic propagation path (eardrum-ossical path) through the auditory canal and (2) sound pressure amplitude in the cochlear shell (relative to the air-borne sound pressure amplitude) via the alternate propagation paths. A 3D finite-element solid mesh was constructed using a digital image database of an adult male head. Coupled acoustic-mechanical finite-element analysis (FEA) was used to model the wave propagation through the fluid-solid-fluid media.&quot;<br>

<p class="font-italic">Th. Kermanidis, G. Labeas, K.I. Tserpes and Sp. Pantelakis</p>
<p>A three-dimensional progressive damage model was developed in order to simulate the damage accumulation of bolted single-lap composite joints under in-plane tensile loading. This model is capable of predicting the residual strength and residual stiffness of laminates with arbitrary lay-ups, geometries and bolt positions. The parametric study includes stress analysis, failure analysis and material property degradation. Stress analysis of the three-dimensional geometry was performed using the ANSYS FE code. Failure analysis and degradation of material properties were implemented using a progressive damage model, which is incorporated in an ANSYS macro-routine. The progressive model utilizes a set of stress-based Hashin-type criteria and a set of appropriate degradation rules. A parametric study was performed to examine the effect of bolt position and friction upon residual strength and damage accumulation.</p>

<p>&quot;Metal closures, with an integrated gasket, are widely used in the food industry to ensure the sealing of the glass bottles by setting. The success of this bottle-capping is due to the relevant choice of the variables in the manufacturing process. Actually, the effects of the various variables of the process are not precisely understood.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In this paper, the leakage pressure of an assembly, with given parameters of a standard setting operation is predicted. The study is concentrated firstly on the simulation of setting the cap on the bottle, and secondly, on the global distribution of the efforts of contact on the gasket according to the internal pressure. Finally, the leakage pressure of the assembly is determined using practical tests that relate the leakage pressure with the global force exerted on the gasket.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">J.S. Corbin</p>
<p>&quot;Solder Ball Connect (SBC) is a second-level surface mount electronics packaging technology in which ceramic modules containing one or more chips are joined to a circuit card (FR-4) by means of an array of nonhomogeneous solder columns. These columns consist of a high-temperature-melting 90%Pb/lO%Sn solder sphere attached to the module and card with eutectic solder fillets. The solder structures accommodate the bulk of the strain (which is due to the thermal- expansion mismatch between FR-4 and the 9211 ceramic of the modules) generated during power cycling. If the solder structures are not properly designed, the thermal strain can be a source of premature fatigue failure. In this work, finite element analysis is used to characterize the plastic strains that develop in the SBC interconnection during thermal cycling. Since plastic strain is a dominant parameter that influences low-cycle fatigue, it is used as a basis of comparison for various structural alternatives. Designed experiment techniques are used to systematically evaluate the thermal strain sensitivity to structural variables. Results are used to identify an optimally reliable structure that is robust in terms of assembly-process variables.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Bret Zahn</p>
<p>&quot;Viscoplastic finite-element simulation methodologies were utilized to predict solder joint reliability for a same die size, stacked, chip scale, ball grid array package under accelerated temperature cycling conditions (-40C to +125C, 15min ramps/15min dwells). The effects of multiple die attach material configurations were investigated along with the thickness of the mold cap and spacer die. The solder structures accommodate the bulk of the plastic strain that is generated during accelerated temperature cycling due to the thermal expansion mismatch between the various materials that encompass the stacked die package. Since plastic strain is a dominant parameter that influences low-cycle fatigue, it was used as a basis for evaluation of solder joint structural integrity. The paper discusses the analysis methodologies as implemented in the ANSYS finite element simulation software tool and the corresponding results for the solder joint fatigue life. Some ANSYS parametric design language commands are included for the benefit of those readers who are familiar with the tool.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Wilhelm Rust</p>
<p>&quot;After discussing general properties of implicit Finite Element analysis using ANSYS and explicit analysis using LS-DYNA it is shown when and how quasi-static limit load analyses can be performed by a transient analysis using explicit time integration. Then we focus on the remaining benefits of implicit analysis and how a proper combination of ANSYS and LS-DYNA can be used to prepare the transient analysis by common preprocessing and static analysis steps. Aspects of discretization, solution control, consideration of imperfections and methods of checking the results are outlined.&quot;[ANSYS LS-DYNA, Nonlinear, version unspecified]</p>

<p class="font-italic">Yongrae Roh and Butrus T. Khuri-Yakub</p>
<p>&quot;A finite element model of cMUTs is constructed using the commercial code ANSYS. The complex load impedance seen by individual cells is compared with the plane wave real impedance seen by a parallel combination of the cells to make a transducer. The result shows the origin and level of crosstalk between array elements, with evidence of coupling through Stoneley and Lamb waves.&quot; (acoustics)</p>

<p class="font-italic">S.H. Pundale, R.J. Rogers, G.R. Nadkarni</p>
<p>&quot;This investigation is the first to deal with the modeling and prediction of effective elastic modulus of ductile irons using finite elements. Both plane stress and axisymmetric formulations were used to predict elastic moduli. With finite elements, it is possible to include microstructural parameters that are extremely difficult or impossible to model analytically. Assuming that the graphite nodules act as voids, the effective elastic modulus was modeled by considering the effect of small strains for nodule variables of volume fraction, shape, size and distribution. (No matrix variables have been considered.)&quot;</p>
