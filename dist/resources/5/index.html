<p class="font-italic">Jerome Montgomery</p>
<p>&quot;Modeling bolts for three-dimensional finite element applications have, and still continue to raise questions. The limitations on model size sometimes make modeling of solid bolts impractical. Therefore, many analysts choose other methods to model bolts. Line elements with coupled nodes and line elements with spider beams are a couple of alternative approaches. This paper looks at a few methods for modeling pretension bolted joints using the finite element method (ANSYS 5.7). Pretension is modeled using ANSYS pretension elements (PRETS179) which can be used on solid or line element types. Surface-to-surface contact elements are used to account for varying contact distribution along flanges. Bolt head and nut behavior is modeled by, coupled nodes, beam elements, rigid body elements (RBE3), or solids. Bolt stud is modeled by solid elements, beam elements, pipe elements, or link elements. The choice of line elements versus solid elements is determined by the degree of complexity sought. The pros and cons of different simulations are also discussed.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Jonathan Raub</p>
<p>&quot;The modeling of diesel engine cylinder head gasket joints is complicated by the nonlinear response of the head gasket’s materials. Linearization of these material responses can lead to significant errors in the solution’s results. The 1-dimensional nonlinear approximation made by the Gasket material option of the SOLID185 element sufficiently captures the response of the nonlinear gasket materials while maintaining practical solution times for the large model sizes associated with multi-cylinder head gasket joint models. This paper will give an overview of the model building and assembly process used to create a head gasket joint model, describe the nonlinear nature of the materials used in the model, and present comparisons of the model’s results with experimental measurements.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">James Nabity</p>
<p>The recent advent of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) or micro-devices has generated excitement in many diverse fields. In the area of micro-fluidics liquid pumps are highly desirable for fluid transport and atomization.  A recent and popular example of this is the inkjet, which self-aspirates ink from a reservoir and then transports it to a chamber for expulsion as a single droplet during the printing process. Extending this technology to other potential applications requires analytical and computational tools for design. Several computational software packages are commercially available, such as CoventorWareTM, FLUENTTM, and  ANSYSTM [1-3], but each is difficult to use and to date only ANSYS has been able to solve this fully coupled multi-physics problem. Thus, simplified analytical models are attractive for preliminary design and analysis.  This paper describes a quasi one-dimensional model developed for the design and analysis of an electrostatically actuated diaphragm pump.  The attributes and assumptions of this model will be presented.  Finally, performance results obtained for a MEMS diaphragm pump will be compared to ANSYS three-dimensional time-accurate results.</p>

<p class="font-italic">M. Thoben, W. Staiger, J. Wilde</p>
<p>&quot;Thermomechanical damage is one of the principal failure causes of microcomponents and microsystems. Often the basic defect mechanisms are crack initiation and subsequent crack propagation in interfaces or materials. The fatigue behavior of microcomponents can in many cases be described by the Manson-Coffin-Formula. This model is well-suited for comparison of different designs relative to each other but it will fail when a realistic lifetime prognosis is expected. Therefore we worked out a concept which is based on the computation of the strain range distribution in the interconnection by finite elements simulations and subsequent calculation of the cyclic crack propagation rate. Using this method in combination with calibration measurements it is possible to predict the lifetime of electronic assemblies with significantly improved precision compared to the Low-Cycle-Fatigue approaches.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Tae Hee Lee, Kwangki Lee, Kwang Soon Lee</p>
<p>&quot;The ultimate goal of simulation that represents the behaviour of structures is to optimize their response performances within the specific requirements and needs with respect to the design variables. The first step of the design of cathode ray tubes is to design the glass geometry, called funnel geometry, to endure the vacuum stress because it is a main structure of cathode ray tubes. In order to create 3-dimensional funnel geometry in the cathode ray tubes, higher order response surface model is used instead of NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines) or Bezier curve because it is more robust for understanding the geometry change in finite element analysis. By combining finite element analysis, response surface model and sequential quadratic programming within the process integration framework, the shape optimization of a funnel is successfully performed and the maximum stress is reduced to almost half of the current one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A macro file is a file which contains Ansys commands. If you save your macro in your working directory or in the macro directory (see /PSEARCH command) you just enter the macro name in the command line and all these commands will be executed. You can even nest macros: from your main file you call e.g. zzmacro1 which again calls zzmacro2. The only problem is that a macro could change - and you would probably not notice that - the value of a parameter you are using in your main input file. This will be the case if the same parameter name is used accidentally in both the macro and your main input. Let's see how one can avoid these nasty errors - just click on the link!&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">J.M. Gerard, J. Ohayon, V. Luboz, P. Perrier, Y. Paya</p>
<p>&quot;This paper aims at characterizing the mechanical behavior of two human anatomical structures, namely the tongue and the cheek. For this, an indentation experiment was provided, by measuring the mechanical response of tongue and cheek tissues removed from the fresh cadaver of a 74 year old woman. Non-linear relationships were observed between the force applied to the tissues and the corresponding displacements. To infer the mechanical constitutive laws from these measurements, a finite element (FE) analysis was provided. This analysis aimed at simulating the indentation experiment. An optimization process was used to determine the FE constitutive laws that provided the non-linear force/displacements observed during the indentation experiments. The tongue constitutive law was used for simulations provided by a 3D FE biomechanical model of the human tongue. This dynamical model was designed to study speech production. Given a set of tongue muscular commands, which levels correspond to the force classically measured during speech production, the FE model successfully simulated the main tongue movements observed during speech data.&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;In this paper we will present a variety of novel horn designs, which overcome some of the limitations discussed above. One particular design that has been found to overcome these limitations is the folded horn. In this design the horn elements are folded which reduce the overall length of the resonator (physical length) but maintain or increase the acoustic length. In addition initial experiments indicate that the tip displacement can be further adjusted by phasing the bending displacements and the extensional displacements. The experimental results for a variety of these and other novel horn designs will be presented and compared to the results predicted by theory.&quot;<br>

<p class="font-italic">Karen L. Troy and Mark D. Grabiner</p>
<p>&quot;Distal radius fractures are among the most common fall-related injuries in older women. Numerous studies have quantified upper extremity fall biomechanics with the goal of identifying possible interventions to reduce the peak force on the wrists, thereby reducing the number of fractures. Fracture initiation depends both on the force applied to the bone and upon the strength of the bone itself; thus, poor bone quality has been implicated as a factor in distal radius fractures. Generally, an intervention to improve bone quality (such as antiresorptive therapy) is considered successful if bone mineral density (BMD) can be increased by 2-4%.<br>
Cadaver and finite element studies have previously quantified the force required to cause a distal radius fracture. To date, however, only simple axial loads on the radius have been considered. Because most falls onto the hands result in off-axis loads, we considered the possibility that a combination of loading modes would significantly influence the fracture strength of the distal radius. Here, we used a validated finite element model of the distal radius, scaphoid, and lunate, to explore the effects of loading direction and changes in BMD on predicted fracture strength.&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;We present a new and unique software program, IMSET, capable of finding optimal designs for computer experiments. A finite-element simulation of a micro-machined flow sensor was used to illustrate macromodel generation and to compare the quality of the IMSET design with other approaches.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Christopher J. Morris and Fred K. Forster</p>
<p>&quot;Piezoelectric bimorph actuation has been successfully used in numerous types of microdevices, most notably micropumps. However, even for the simple case of circular geometry, analytical treatments are severely limited. This study utilized the finite-element method to optimize the deflection of a circular bimorph consisting of a single piezoelectric actuator, bonding material and elastic plate of finite dimensions. Optimum actuator dimensions were determined for given plate dimensions, actuator-to-plate stiffness ratio and bonding layer thickness.&quot; (PLANE13)</p>

<p class="font-italic">Zane E. Johnson, Nathan R. Schneck</p>
<p>&quot;Previously benchmarked finite-element (FE) models of a stacked chip scale package (CSP) are used to identify optimum underfill material properties under drop-impact and accelerated temperature cycling (ATC) stress conditions. The simulation sets indicate that an underfill having a modulus of 2–6 GPa and CTE of 25 ppm/K maximizes drop life and does no harm to ATC performance for both Sn63Pb37 and SAC305 solder joints. The methodology described can be applied to other package styles, material sets, and stress conditions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Probabilistic Design System (PDS) of ANSYS provides a very powerful tool in understanding the effect of uncertainties in one’s design. The details of PDS are covered in the online help, so this memo will discuss the specific case of setting up serial and parallel PDS runs as well as performing nonlinear analyses with PDS.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is a simple program written in Turbo pascal which I find very useful for converting the output from ANSYS (prvar, prnsol, etc) into columns, while removing the headers at the start and between the page listings. The program is used at a DOS prompt and one types in: pow2mat col filein fileout , where col are the number of columns in the output, filein MUST have an extension .val and fileout WILL have an extension .txt. You do NOT type in the extensions, they are default. For example, you would type pow2mat 7 nodelist nodelist which would extract 7 columns from the file nodelist.val and write a stripped file called nodelist.txt . If you have several files to convert, you can use the DOS FOR command as follows:<br>
FOR %I IN (*.val) DO pow2mat 3 %~nI %~nI&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have written a macro that calculates the total force along the three axes from applied pressure. I find this macro to be useful just to make sure that the pressure I'm applying on a curved surface is accurate and also it gives a feel for the mesh discretization where the pressure is applied. The user has to basically identify the elements with a particular magnitude of pressure and save the list file (SFELIS.lis). The macro does everything else automatically. The downside to the macro is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right now it only handles 10 node tet elements.</li>
<li>The pressure has to be uniform<br>
The user will have to modify some of the fields in the macro as well as the c-shell file prescalc.&quot;</li>
</ol>
