<p class="font-italic">Jean-Michel Gérard, Reiner Wilhelms-Tricarico, Pascal Perrier &amp; Yohan Payan</p>
<p>&quot;A 3D biomechanical dynamical model of human tongue is presented, that is elaborated in the aim to test hypotheses about speech motor control. Tissue elastic properties are accounted for in Finite Element Modeling (FEM). The FEM mesh was designed in order to facilitate the implementation of muscle arrangement within the tongue. Therefore, its structure was determined on the basis of accurate anatomical data about the tongue. Mechanically, the hypothesis of hyperelasticity was adopted with the Mooney-Rivlin formulation of the strain energy function. Muscles are modeled as general force generators that act on anatomically specified sets of nodes of the FEM structure. The 8 muscles that are known to be largely involved in the production of basic speech movements are modeled. The model and the solving of the Lagrangian equations of movement are implemented using the ANSYS™ software. Simulations of the influence of muscle activations onto the tongue shape are presented and analyzed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We report on the development of a 64-pixel high performance linear thermopile array chip designed for vacuum environment based on a silicon nitride membrane as substrate, Bi0.87Sb0.13/Sb as thermoelectric materials combination and an Ag-black broadband absorber layer. The array chip was mounted on a ceramic substrate and placed on the socket of a commercial hybrid package with 64 pins. Measurements of the linear array chip in vacuum environment and in absence of an entrance filter delivered a responsivity of 245 V/W, a sensitivity of 166 µVm˛/W, a specific detectivity of 1.6x109 cmHz1/2/W at an electrical resistance of 9 k and a thermal time constant of 150 ms. The pixelto- pixel cross-talk was reduced to less than 0.4 % due to slits in the membrane between adjacent pixels made by dry etching.&quot;<br>

<p class="font-italic">E.M. Sparrow, J.P. Abraham, P.W. Chevalier</p>
<p>&quot;The method of Design of Simulation (DOS) was used to guide and enhance a numerical simulation of fluid flow and heat transfer through offset-fin arrays which form the interior geometry of a cold plate. The basic problem involved 11 independent parameters. This prohibitive parametric burden was lessened by the creative use of nondimensionalization that was brought to fruition by a special transformation of the boundary conditions. Subsequent to the reduction of the number of parameters, the DOS method was employed to limit the number of simulation runs while maintaining an accurate representation of the parameter space. The DOS method also provided excellent correlations of both the dimensionless heat transfer and pressure drop results. The results were evaluated with respect to the Colburn Analogy for heat and momentum transfer. It was found that the offseting of the fins created a larger increase in the friction factor than that which was realized for the dimensionless heat transfer coefficient.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Keyue Shen, Xiaofang Chen, Min Guo, Jing Cheng</p>
<p>&quot;Rapid heat transfer is crucial for an efficient polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and this makes temperature control one of the most essential features in a micro-PCR system, which always includes a heater and a sensor composing a closed-loop. Yet, the fabrication of the heater and the sensor often prevented micro-PCR systems from achieving both cost-effectiveness and fabrication-easiness. For most of the early researches micromachining techniques were used to allow sensors and heaters be integrated on a silicon or glass chip. However, the cost prevented them from wide applications. The work described in this paper is part of our effort to solve the cost/fabrication dilemma. An innovative digital temperature control system was developed by introducing a heater/sensor switching procedure. Only one temperature controlling element fabricated by flexible printed circuit technology was utilized in the constructed PCR device with minimum fabrication steps. The glass chip-based device was made from low cost materials and assembled with adhesive bonding. Through seemingly simple steps, we obtained both disposability and portability at the same time. Temperature stability within ±0.3 ?C and a transitional rate of 8 ?C/s during heating/cooling was achieved. A 244 bp DNA fragment of hepatitis C virus was successfully amplified in our device by a three-stage thermal cycling process. Further improvement was assisted by finite element analysis, and demonstrated by experiment.&quot;<br>

<p class="font-italic">A. Menciassi, S. Gorini, G. Pernorio, P. Dario</p>
<p>&quot;This paper presents the design and development of a microrobot which aims to replicate the locomotion principle of earthworms. The undulatory locomotion of living earthworms has been investigated deeply from the biological point of view, but attempts of replication of earthworm models in real size are limited. The authors designed an artificial earthworm with four modules which can be driven independently according to defined undulatory patterns with a typical frequency of 0.5 Hz. Each module is actuated by one or more SMA springs whose configuration has been designed in order to limit the wiring problems and optimizing working frequency. The robot is covered by a shaped silicone material which can be used as a platform to insert tiny legs for obtaining differential friction conditions. Preliminary tests demonstrate that the earthworm prototypes can move with a speed of 0.22 mm/s, thus approximating the behavior of biological earthworms. earthworms. Hopefully, the artificial moving earthworm will constitute a platform for improving the knowledge of mechanisms regulating motion and perception abilities of these creatures.&quot;<br>

<p class="font-italic">Jacques Ohayon, Gérard Finet, François Treyve, Gilles Rioufol and Olivier Dubreuil</p>
<p>&quot;This paper aims at predicting the plaque rupture location of one patient with stable angina and scheduled to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. The peak circumferential stress (PCS) is considered as the determining biomechanical factor in the mechanisms leading to rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque and is often used as a predictor of atherosclerotic plaque rupture location. Up to now, to define the site of PCS concentrations, twodimensional (2D) finite element (FE) analyses were performed on the smallest luminal cross-sectional area of the coronary plaque. In-vivo three-dimensional (3D) FE modeling of atherosclerotic coronaries may be very valuable and more accurate than the 2D FE analysis in helping cardiologists evaluate the risk of spontaneous plaque rupture in a patient. In this work, the performances of the 2D and 3D FE approaches have been compared and the limits of the 2D structural analysis has been pointed out.&quot;<br>

The approach combines range data and the mechanics and motion dynamics of human tissues. Active contours are employed to locate regions of interest and to find displacements of feature points using automatically established correspondences. Changes in strain distribution over time are evaluated. Given images at two time instances and their corresponding features, the finite element method is used to synthesize strain distributions of the underlying tissues.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">K. Mutamba, J. Pfeiffer, J. Peerlings, R. Riemenschneider and N. Dragojevic</p>
<p>&quot;Due to the recent progress in the fabrication of micro-optical devices and the maturity reached in the integration of electromechanical functions on various semiconductor micro-devices, new concepts for optical microelectromechanical systems (OMEMS) have emerged... Analyses have been carried out with the ANSYS FEM (Finite Elements Method) Program for two types of electrostatically actuated Fabry-Pérot filters.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Sheldon Imaoka (ANSYS, Inc.)</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the flexibility and automation APDL (ANSYS Parametric Design Language) provides, many users tend to write input files and macros in addition to using the GUI.<br>
There are currently no recognized ‘standards’ of writing APDL macros or input files, although there may exist standards within companies on APDL coding. The lack of APDL coding standards may make inheriting someone else’s input files or macros more difficult. Also, parameter or component conflicts may also arise when using multiple macros.<br>
This memo hopes to provide some ideas for groups or individuals wishing to develop APDL standards in writing macros or input files.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Sheldon Imaoka (ANSYS, Inc.)</p>
<p>&quot;Vector and matrix operations in APDL are an invaluable method of manipulating array data, as they provide very fast, computationally efficient means of helping the user perform pre- or post-processing operations on the model.<br>
There are many ways of storing data, ranging from arrays to tables to strings. Moreover, manipulation of numerical data can be in the form of vectors or matrices via the *Vxxx and *Mxxx commands, respectively. The user is referred to the APDL Programmer’s Guide in the ANSYS online help for a thorough discussion of the capabilities of APDL, but, in this memo, a basic introduction to vector operations will be covered.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">W. Ebenstein, J. Fowler, S. Oh, V. Vassilakopoulos, and C. Wang</p>
<p>&quot;This report summarizes measurements and calculations using the most recently proposed cooling scheme. Heat generated by the ASDBLR and DTMROC stamp boards is conducted to an aluminum plate sandwiched between the upper and lower stamp boards (hereafter referred to as the 'middle cooling plate'). The heat is then carried up through a vertical aluminum post, and finally to a large aluminum plate above all of the upper stamp boards (the 'upper cooling plate'), to which cooling tubes are attached.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Ahmer Syed</p>
<p>&quot;This paper describes in detail the life prediction models for SnAgCu solder joints. The models are based on published constitutive equations for this alloy and thermal cycle fatigue data on actual components. The approach uses advance finite element modeling and analysis techniques and is based on mechanics of deformation. Both accumulated creep strain and creep strain energy density based models are developed. The model has been correlated with a number of data points and predicts life within 25% in most cases. The framework of modeling and prediction methodology described here is fully compatible with the framework used for SnPb solder previously.&quot;</p>
