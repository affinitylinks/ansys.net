<p>&quot;The paper presents a new concept to predict viscoplastic deformations in components under thermal mechanical loading. This approach is based both on material data from uniaxial creep tests and additional laboratory component tests to consider the influence of multiaxiality. This concept was used for analysis of feature tests of flat tensile specimens with central hole. The maximum test temperature was 600 °C and the surface of the hole was attacked by cyclic thermal shocks.&quot;(This paper refers to use of ANSYS User-Defined Materials.

<p>&quot;An algebraic multigrid algorithm for symmetric, positive definite linear systems is developed based on the concept of prolongation by smoothed aggregation. Coarse levels are generated automatically. We present a set of requirements motivated heuristically by a convergence theory. The algorithm then attempts to satisfy the requirements. Input to the method are the coefficient matrix and zero energy modes, which are determined from nodal coordinates and knowledge of the differential equation. Efficiency of the resulting algorithm is demonstrated by computational results on real world problems from solid elasticity, plate bending, and shells.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">David A. Johnston, Charles J. Cross, J. Mitch Wolff</p>
<p>&quot;Aeroelastic stability and response analyses used in the design of turbomachinery blading are typically uncoupled: the unsteady aerodynamics and structural dynamics are treated in separate models, with boundary conditions sequentially updated after stationary periodic convergence is met. Higher fidelity simulations are achieved by coupling the fluid and structure domains such that boundary conditions are updated once or several times per physical time step of the simulation.&quot;&quot;As a starting point, the turbomachinery CFD research code TURBO (Chen and Briley, 2001) and the commercial structural solver ANSYSŪ has been chosen for coupling, although FSI is designed with modularity for future inclusion of other fluid and structural solvers.&quot;<br>

<p class="font-italic">Michel Lesoinne and Kendall Pierson</p>
<p>&quot;Until now, many implementations of the FETI method have been designed either as sequential codes on a single CPU, or as parallel implementations with a One Subdomain per Processor approach. This approach has been particularly typical of implementations on distributed memory architectures such as the IBM SP2. In the last couple of years, several computer manufacturers have introduced new machines with a Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) programming model {e.g. SGI Origin 2000, or HP Exemplar. In such architectures, the physical memory is distributed among the processors or CPU boards but any memory location can be accessed logically by any CPU independently of where the particular memory page being accessed has physically been allocated. As more and more machines of this type are available with a relatively small number of processors, the interest in implementing FETI with an independent number of subdomains and processor has increased. We report on such an implementation of FETI and highlight the benefits of this feature. We have found that medium size to large problems can be solved even on a sequential machine with time and memory requirements that are one to two order of magnitude better than a direct solver.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Yasumasa Shoji, Satoshi Nagata</p>
<p>&quot;The analysis of gasketted flanges is now becoming an essential technique to design pressure vessels or piping, because the design code is being modified. On the other hand, the gasket has an extreme nonlinearity which causes the analysis to be very difficult, especially using linear material properties. A finite element analysis program other than ANSYS has the element library for gasket element, but ANSYS does not have it yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The authors developed a method to model this nonlinear gasket by using the elements available in ANSYS Rel. 5.5 for 2-dimensional axisymmetric analysis and those in Rel. 5.6 for 3-dimensional analysis. In this paper, the concept and the procedure of the modeling is introduced. The data input is possible using a template, without using any other ANSYS commands. The whole analysis execution is controlled by APDL.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An innovative graphite/epoxy-concrete (G/E-C) cross-section was developed and tested under two-point static loading. Finite element analysis and theoretical modeling of the cross-section was performed. The cross-section was a box girder with an outer G/E U-beam and inner G/E box beam with concrete webs and flange in between. Shear connection between G/E box beam and concrete slab was provided by a two-part structural epoxy resin. Additional shear connection was provided by steel stirrups located at 254 mm (10 in.) spacing along longitudinal axis of the test specimen. It was observed that, steel stirrups contributed the load carrying capacity after initiation of slippage between G/E beams and concrete. Moreover, a series of bond strength tests were performed to examine the behavior of structural epoxy resin for connection between G/E and concrete. Six G/E strips were subjected to tensile tests to evaluate the longitudinal and transverse elastic moduli of the laminate. Using the proper material properties and assumptions, it was possible to demonstrate the behavior of the section under static loads theoretically and in finite element analysis.&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;This paper aims at developing a finite element model of glued laminated girder bridges that can predict accurately the analytical behavior of the bridges. Two models have been developed to study the characteristics of this type of bridge. Two case studies have been considered to validate the accuracy of the models. The first case study is a long span single-lane bridge, the Tuscaloosa Bridge, in Alabama. The second case study is a medium span two-lane bridge, the Cow Gu lch Bridge, in Montana. The models show good correlation with the experimental data and hence, the models can be used to find the maximum deflections in the bridge.&quot;Use of ANSYS 5.0 (1992 version)</p>

<p class="font-italic">David M. Moses, Helmut G.L. Prion</p>
<p>&quot;Two case studies are summarized using anisotropic plasticity and the Weibull weakest link failure model to predict the behavior of wood and wood composites. The linear elastic orthotropic model normally used for wood is shown to be insufficient for the prediction of ultimate strength in wood. Non-linear, non-recoverable behavior in compression in each of the orthogonal material directions is of particular interest in cases where localized crushing governs the load-displacement behavior of wood.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The anisotropic plasticity option in ANSYS was used to predict yielding and post-yield behavior for the wood composite used in this study because yield stresses in orthogonal directions were found to be in the ratio of 1:1.2:5. A user-programmable Fortran subroutine was developed for ANSYS to carry out the failure analysis (and to calculate the volume integration of the stresses) at each load-step in post-processing. The model was verified using two cases: I) the ASTM D143 shear block test, and II) bolted connections.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A ‘thin’ fibrous cap atheroma is the typical morphological characteristic of vulnerable plaque. Yet the very pathological studies that have provided these descriptions have also shown the actual prediction of plaque rupture to be rather less exact. Other relevant characteristics must be involved in the mechanisms of plaque rupture—blood pressure loading (P) and the material properties of the soft atheromatous core—as predictors of the distribution of the peak circumferential stress (PCS) locations.&quot;<br>

<p class="font-italic">Sheldon Imaoka (ANSYS, Inc.)</p>
<p>&quot;The Chaboche nonlinear kinematic hardening model was added in ANSYS 5.6 to complement the existing isotropic and kinematic hardening rules that users relied on. Despite its availability for nearly ten years as of the time of this writing, the Chaboche model has enjoyed limited popularity, in part because of the perceived complexity of calibrating the material parameters. This memo hopes to introduce the basics related to the Chaboche nonlinear kinematic model.&quot;<br>

<p class="font-italic">Aaron Acton (ANSYS, Inc.)</p>
<p>&quot;This article presents a method for obtaining full harmonic solutions clustered around potential peak responses. Full harmonic analyses provide exact solutions, typically calculated at equally spaced intervals over the desired frequency range. Mode-superposition analyses, however, provide approximate solutions, but can be clustered around potential resonant peaks. The hybrid method discussed in this article uses a modal solution to determine natural frequencies, which are then used to calculate clusters of points surrounding those frequencies. Full harmonic solutions can then be performed at these clustered points. Examples and input les are provided in order to utilize this method.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Matthieu Chabanas, Yohan Payan, Christophe Marecaux, Pascal Swider, and Franck Boutault</p>
<p>&quot;A Finite Element model of the face soft tissue is proposed to simulate the morphological outcomes of maxillofacial surgery. Three modelling options are implemented: a linear elastic model with small and large deformation hypothesis, and an hyperelastic Mooney-Rivlin model. An evaluation procedure based on a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the simulations with a post-operative CT scan is detailed. It is then applied to one clinical case to evaluate the differences between the three models, and with the actual patient morphology. First results shows in particular that for a “simple” clinical procedure where stress is less than 20%, a linear model seams sufficient for a correct modelling.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Carl Howard (University of Adelaide)</p>
<p>&quot;The purpose of this investigation was to compare the two modelling techniques for an infinite boundary. The first technique involves setting the elements on the edges of the model to have an absorptive property by changing the material properties so that mu=1. The second technique involves the use of infinite elements (infinite129) that must be placed on a constant radius curvature.&quot;</p>

<p class="font-italic">Sheldon Imaoka (ANSYS, Inc.)</p>
<p>&quot;ANSYS User Programmable Features (UPFs) are quite powerful means of customizing ANSYS beyond the scripting capabilities of the ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL). Writing one’s own constitutive models or complex loading functions or even creating a user-defined element are possible with UPFs.</p>
<p>Because some users may find it challenging to get started using UPFs, this memo hopes to discuss general issues related to compiling and linking a customized version of ANSYS for Windows and Linux environments.&quot;</p>
